\set QUIET 1
-- above: doesn't prompt the commands in this file when psql start

-- Make NULLs more visible
\pset null '‚úù'

-- Transform tab-completed keywords to uppercase
\set COMP_KEYWORD_CASE upper

-- Shows how much time commands take
\timing

-- A slightly different prompt. Shows backend PID, which I think is nice
--\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1m%][%/] %p # '

-- Trick:
-- \e to edit a buffer (SQL command)
-- \C `clear` to clear everytime it's displayed
-- \watch 1 to run that every second on a clear screen

-- Auto-use expanded mode for big outputs
\x auto

\unset QUIET
